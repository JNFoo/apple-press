| Date | Type | Change |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-08 | Added | The small logo now includes the words ("Apple" over "Press", from the Title setting), left of the stage bar |
| 2026-10-08 | Added | When the big apple scrolls out of view on a narrow window or phone, it now shrinks into the small apple in the top bar (a flying copy, 0.4 s); scrolling back up grows it back out of the small apple into the big one. Skipped in Calm effects and with reduced motion |
| 2026-10-08 | Added | A version number (the build's date and time, USA Eastern, e.g. 2026.10.08.2323) shows at the bottom right of the title screen and above the font credits at the bottom of the page. Every new build gets a new one automatically |
| 2026-10-08 | Added | A small game logo (the title-screen apple, never dressed for a season) sits to the left of the stage bar at the top |
| 2026-10-08 | Changed | The fireworks over the city on the National Brand stage now show only on night (dark mode) scenes, not on daytime ones |
| 2026-10-08 | Fixed | The chimney on the Cider Mill background now sits properly on the roof |
| 2026-10-08 | Fixed | In the tour, the Click upgrades, Helper upgrades and Prices go up steps now light up one upgrade (or just its price) instead of the whole shop |
| 2026-10-08 | Changed | The first-time tour is rewritten for children about 6 years old: short sentences and simple words, split into 18 small steps (was 7), with separate steps for each number under the apple, click upgrades, helper upgrades, new stages, and the special apples, sticker book, save and help buttons |
| 2026-10-08 | Changed | The curtains' fly-through at the end of a promotion is lighter: it zooms to 1.5x instead of 1.9x and finishes 200 ms sooner, because a full-screen layer scaling while fading made the browser's compositor drop frames (profile of the hosted page showed long composites with texture-cache churn during that moment) |
| 2026-10-08 | Changed | The title screen no longer comes back after the game has been left untouched for an hour (it did not work well on the online versions) |
| 2026-10-08 | Changed | Smoother curtains and presses: the next stage's curtain is painted about five times faster (the same picture, checked to be identical), the falling-pieces layer no longer makes the browser do extra layout work on every press, and a press reads the page layout once instead of three times |
| 2026-10-08 | Fixed | A thin strip under the gold hem at the bottom of the closing curtains was see-through, so the busy game behind it showed (and seemed to flicker); it is now a solid dark stage floor, in both looks |
| 2026-10-08 | Added | Finishing the first-time tour (not skipping it) sends a golden apple floating across the scene as a gift, once per browser; it is bigger and slower than usual so a first-time player can catch it |
| 2026-10-08 | Added | First-time tour: right after the title screen a brand-new player gets a short guided look at the page (the story of the game, the big apple, the counters, upgrades, stage bar and bottom buttons), with Skip and Back; "Show me around" in How to play brings it back |
| 2026-10-08 | Changed | The font credits at the bottom and the How to play panel no longer name the hidden unlockable look until it has been unlocked |
| 2026-10-08 | Fixed | Stage 3 and stage 11 curtains showed up solid black in the shared (player) copy of the game, because its compressed style sheet writes those two colors as names (maroon, coral) that the curtain painter could not read; the browser now converts the color first |
| 2026-10-08 | Changed | The fiery ring and the dashed orbit ring now turn once per press-per-second shown on the counter (they used to turn twice) |
| 2026-10-08 | Fixed | Stage 3's curtains are no longer nearly black: the very dark maroon is brightened to a rich crimson velvet with softer shading, in every look |
| 2026-10-08 | Changed | The first adventure is shorter: a brand-new game ends after stage 6 (National Brand) with "The Orchard Is Famous!". "Start again" then gives the full 13 stages; "Start over" begins a short first adventure again; saves already in the middle of a run keep all 13 stages |
| 2026-10-08 | Changed | Ending is gentler: the celebration card shows first with a "See my story" button; the Apple Story no longer pops up by itself and now opens with a "You did it!" cover page (a short first adventure ends it with "To be continued…") |
| 2026-10-08 | Fixed | Progress bars on stages 5, 6 and 9 are deeper (gold, amber, teal) so the growing part shows clearly |
| 2026-10-08 | Changed | Bonus shop: Auto Clicker now costs 35 credits (was 7) and Robot Arm 100 (was 16), and both sit at the end of the list |
| 2026-10-08 | Fixed | Stage 13's progress bar fill is a deeper periwinkle so it shows against the light bar |
| 2026-10-08 | Changed | Player copy 28 KB smaller: one flexible Figtree file instead of three, and the unused lighter Bricolage title weight removed; no visible change |
| 2026-10-08 | Changed | Background petals, fireflies and stars are now small page pieces the browser moves itself, instead of a full-screen picture redrawn 60 times a second |
| 2026-10-08 | Changed | Self-extracting small copy added (`apple-press-small.html`, 266 KB instead of 647 KB): the game is squeezed inside and the browser unpacks it as the page opens; older browsers (before 2023) get a short message pointing to the regular file |
| 2026-10-08 | Changed | Player copy tidied: font layout features trimmed to the ones used (−6 KB), tags written more briefly (−15 KB raw) |
| 2026-10-08 | Changed | The fiery ring around the apple no longer shows on stages 7 to 12, which already have the orbit ring |
| 2026-10-08 | Fixed | Curtain colors checked on all 13 stages against their apples and backdrops: yellow (stage 5), lavender (stage 13) and magenta (stage 10) velvet now match their stage color more closely |
| 2026-10-08 | Fixed | Stage 11's curtains no longer look chocolate brown: orange and coral velvet is shaded less deeply in the folds |
| 2026-10-08 | Changed | During a promotion the background particles stop drawing until it closes, and the stage change is done in several small steps behind the shut curtains, to ease the stutter as the card appears |
| 2026-10-08 | Changed | Only the current stage's background picture is kept in the page (about 30% fewer page elements); the progress bar moves in finer-grained steps; about 3 KB of unused style rules removed |
| 2026-10-08 | Fixed | Stage 8 (World Apple Conglomerate): the backdrop behind the promotion card glowed sky blue while its curtains were purple; the glow is now violet to match (the other 12 stages were checked and already match) |
| 2026-10-07 | Changed | The fiery ring around the apple now shows only while you press, on every stage, and spins at twice your clicks-per-second number; the dashed orbit ring is back to stages 7 to 12 only |
| 2026-10-07 | Changed | The orbit ring now shows from the first stage (it still spins faster the faster you press); during a promotion everything behind the celebration is paused to ease the curtain and card stutter in Firefox |
| 2026-10-07 | Changed | Stage curtains are prepared in smaller, spaced-out slivers and wait a moment behind closed curtains before opening, to remove the curtain stutter in Firefox |
| 2026-10-07 | Changed | The player file is 16% smaller (fonts trimmed to the characters the game uses, pictures and script tightened) with no visible change |
| 2026-10-07 | Added | A Capture button in the seasons test that records where the screen, title and buttons are from the moment the page opens, to find the drift on Android; the title screen also locks the page behind it from scrolling |
| 2026-10-07 | Fixed | On Android phones the title screen no longer turns black in dark mode (it is always light), and zooming is turned off so the title screen and buttons cannot slide toward the bottom right |
| 2026-10-07 | Changed | Title screens in the unlockable mode redrawn with hand-placed sprites for every season and holiday, moving in step with the apple (new sandwiches, dove, groundhog, sundae, paw prints, chocolates, lanterns, bags, gifts and a Food Day plate) |
| 2026-10-07 | Added | A taco drawn as a golden shell on its side, and a sombrero, cactus and maracas for Cinco de Mayo on the modern look |
| 2026-10-07 | Fixed | Fireworks on the title screen are visible again (they used white, which vanished on a light screen) and look right in the unlockable mode too |
| 2026-10-07 | Fixed | The title screen waits for its fonts before showing, so the logo and props no longer jump around on load |
| 2026-10-07 | Fixed | The unlockable mode's title screen is always light, so dark theme no longer washes out its art |
| 2026-10-07 | Fixed | The unlockable mode's scenes and title props no longer turn into noise in browsers with strict privacy settings (such as Firefox with resist fingerprinting) |
| 2026-10-07 | Added | If the game is left running untouched for over an hour, the title screen comes back when you return |
| 2026-10-07 | Fixed | Tooltips no longer show through the title screen |
| 2026-10-06 | Added | A "Hold to press" on/off switch at the bottom of the screen, for players who would rather tap |
| 2026-10-06 | Fixed | Holding a finger on the apple now keeps pressing on Android phones, and the phone's long-press menu no longer pops up over the apple |
| 2026-10-05 | Added | Hold your finger on the apple (or the small press button) to press it 5 times a second, with combos building as you hold |
| 2026-10-05 | Added | Save backup panel: copy a save code or download a save file, then load it on any device to keep your progress |
| 2026-10-05 | Fixed | Safer saving: the game never writes a broken save, keeps a backup copy, and saves whenever you switch away from it |
| 2026-10-05 | Fixed | The ending no longer has a bright white flash; its background and card now fade in gently |
| 2026-10-05 | Changed | Each of the 13 stages now has its own color, used for the apple, the curtains, the promotion glow and the buttons |
| 2026-10-05 | Fixed | The moving parts of the background now move separately, which ended the hitch at big combo milestones in the later stages |
| 2026-10-05 | Changed | The biggest combo milestone celebrations were toned down and spread out so they play smoothly |
| 2026-10-05 | Fixed | The background holds still while you tap fast and starts moving again when you stop, which removed stutter in the later stages |
| 2026-10-05 | Added | Velvet stage curtains in the new stage's color close and then part as you fly through to each promotion |
| 2026-10-05 | Added | Promotion celebrations with confetti cannons, sparkle bursts and turning sun rays |
| 2026-10-05 | Changed | The promotion card now drops in gently instead of the old oversized spinning, shaking slam |
| 2026-10-05 | Fixed | Promotions no longer stutter: the busy game is hidden behind the promotion screen, which shows a deep glow in the stage's color |
| 2026-10-05 | Fixed | Big combo counter announcements no longer stutter on phones |
| 2026-10-05 | Fixed | Phones in dark mode no longer darken the apple's shine and the special apples |
| 2026-10-05 | Fixed | The game no longer switches itself to lower effects by mistake after you switch to another app and come back |
| 2026-10-05 | Fixed | Smoother play in the unlockable mode and with long shop lists, especially on phones |
| 2026-10-05 | Changed | The game file got about 5% smaller by tidying the artwork, with no change to how anything looks |
| 2026-10-05 | Changed | New costumes (a fishbowl space helmet, a "Rachel" hairdo, an emo look and a chinstrap beard) replaced the cowboy hat, fedora, towel and soul patch |
| 2026-10-05 | Changed | Hats and helmets got soft shading and shadows in the modern look, and they stay on correctly when the apple turns around |
| 2026-10-03 | Fixed | One damaged number in a save no longer throws away all of your progress |
| 2026-10-03 | Fixed | Apples earned while the game was closed no longer get doubled by a Frenzy boost |
| 2026-10-03 | Added | Scenery pets and friends: a cat, a dog, a garden gnome, a friendly UFO and a nicer rainbow |
| 2026-10-03 | Added | A new bonus shop item that makes regular upgrades cost less |
| 2026-10-03 | Added | Apple Paradise: an optional bonus 14th stage with its own scene and congratulations screen |

| 2026-10-02 | Added | Several special apples can fly by at once, plus a mini press button and an optional frames-per-second counter |
| 2026-10-02 | Added | "Welcome back": helpers keep picking apples for up to 8 hours while the game is closed |
| 2026-10-02 | Added | Light and dark themes, and Full, Lite and Calm effect settings (Lite is chosen automatically on slow machines) |
| 2026-10-02 | Changed | The game only updates the screen when something actually changes, so it runs more smoothly on slower devices |
